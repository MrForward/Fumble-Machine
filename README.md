## 🎯 What It Does

Ever bought something and later thought, *"What if I had invested that money instead?"*

The Fumble Machine answers that question with brutal honesty.

**Example:**
- You bought a **$50 video game** in **January 2020**
- Instead, you could have bought **Bitcoin**
- That $50 would be worth **$500+ today**
- **You fumbled $450** 💀
